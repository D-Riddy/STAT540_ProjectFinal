### **1. Libraries and Setup**
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load the packages for graphing and data wrangling
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```


### **2. Load Data**
```{r load-data}
# Load the dataset
load("data/original/elections_polls.RData")

# Examine the structure of the dataset
str(polls)
```

#### **3. Data Wrangling**
Include code for subsetting and calculating `spread` and `spread_act`:
```{r, data-wrangling}
# Subset polls to keep those ending within 6 weeks before Election Day
polls_subset <- polls %>%
  mutate(endmonth = strftime(enddate, "%m")) %>%
  filter(endmonth %in% c("10", "11"))

# Add columns for the spread between Republican and Democratic votes
polls <- polls %>%
  mutate(
    spread = republican_poll - democrat_poll,  # Polling difference
    spread_act = republican_result - democrat_result  # Actual voting difference
  )

```


---

#### **4. Data Summary and Confidence Intervals**
Manually write the summarization code:
```{r data-summary}
# Group and summarize polls by race_state, year, and state
reduced_polls <- polls %>%
  group_by(race_state, year, state) %>%
  summarize(
    mean_spread = mean(spread, na.rm = TRUE),        # Mean of spread
    sd_spread = sd(spread, na.rm = TRUE),            # Standard deviation of spread
    mean_spread_act = mean(spread_act, na.rm = TRUE),# Mean of actual spread
    n_polls = n()                                    # Number of polls per race
  ) %>%
  ungroup()

# Filter races with fewer than 3 polls and calculate 95% confidence intervals
reduced_polls_filtered <- reduced_polls %>%
  filter(n_polls >= 3) %>%
  mutate(
    ci_lower = mean_spread - 1.96 * (sd_spread / sqrt(n_polls)),  # Lower bound of CI
    ci_upper = mean_spread + 1.96 * (sd_spread / sqrt(n_polls))   # Upper bound of CI
  )
```

#### **5. Visualizations**
Write out the visualization code manually:
```{r visualizations, fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
# Filter data for the 2016 presidential election
plot_data <- reduced_polls_filtered %>%
  filter(grepl("Pres", race_state), year == 2016) %>%
  mutate(state = reorder(state, mean_spread, mean))  # Reorder states by mean_spread

# Plot mean spread with confidence intervals and actual results
ggplot(plot_data, aes(x = state, y = mean_spread)) +
  geom_point() +  # Point estimates (mean_spread)
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), colour = "black", width = 0.8) +  # Confidence intervals
  geom_point(aes(y = mean_spread_act), color = "red") +  # Actual results in red
  theme_classic() +  # Classic theme
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -90, vjust = 0.5)) +  # Rotate x-axis labels
  ylab("Republican - Democrat Spread") +  # Y-axis label
  ggtitle("2016 Presidential Election: Polls (Black) vs Actual Results (Red)") +  # Title
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "grey")  # Horizontal line at y = 0

```

#### **6. Bias Analysis**
Add the bias calculation and analysis code:
```{r bias-analysis}
# Add a bias column to the reduced_polls data frame
reduced_polls <- reduced_polls %>%
  mutate(bias = mean_spread_act - mean_spread)  # Calculate the bias term

# Plot the distribution of bias terms for each year
ggplot(reduced_polls, aes(x = factor(year), y = bias)) +
  geom_boxplot() +  # Create a boxplot for each year
  theme_classic() +  # Apply a classic theme
  xlab("Election Year") +  # Label for x-axis
  ylab("Bias (theta - hat(theta))") +  # Label for y-axis
  ggtitle("Distribution of Bias Terms by Year")  # Add a title

```
